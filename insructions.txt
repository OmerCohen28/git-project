Socket info:
    the server is working on port 55555 and any ip that the computer has (localhost included)

    Send format:
        when sending a message to the server you need to send the length of the message in the first 8 bytes
        example:
            the message "hello world", and the length of the message is 11.
            format: "00000011hello world"
            the length is 11 and it was padded to fit 8 bytes and after that is the message
    
    Recv format:
        when receiving a message you do the opposite, recv the first 8 bytes and then recv the message by the length you got.
        example:
            length = socket.recv(8)  # length will be b"00000011"
            length = int(length)  # length will be 11

            msg = socket.recv(length)  # msg will be b"hello world"
            msg = msg.decode()  # msg will be "hello world"


general game flow:
    1) connect to server and receive client id
    2) send player username to server
    3) wait for all players to join
    4) server sends to all players who the ruler is and the first 5 cards
    5) the ruler sends the strong suit to the server, and the server respond to the ruler "ok" if the suit is fine and "bad" otherwise
    6) server sends all 13 cards to all players and sends the strong suit to all players and the teams as well
    *game starts*
    7) server sends the status of the round to the player that their turn is happening
    8) The player whose turn occurs sends to the server the card he wants to play
    9) server response to the player "ok" if card is fine or "bad_card" if the card is not well formatted or "bad_play" if the card is against the rules
    10) once the round ends the server sends to all players which team won the round and the score of each team and the cards that were played in the round
    11) repeat from (6). if a team reached 7 points the server will send "GAME_OVER" and shut down

    ** if a player disconnect the server will send "PLAYER_DISCONNECTED" and shut down because the game can't continue

Formatting of game flow:
    1) client id in format: "client_id:[id in number from 1-4]"
    2) username format msg: "username:[game-username-by-admin]" //implemented but wont be active until tourney
    4) sends in 2 messages (in order):
        1)the ruler: "ruler:[client_id]"
        2)the first 5 cards: "card|card|card|card|card"
    5) two stages:
        1) strong suit: "set_strong:[SUIT]"
        2) server response: "ok" or "bad"
    6) 13 cards, teams and strong: "card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card|card,teams:[team1]|[team2],strong:[SUIT]"
    7) status: "played_suit:[SUIT - empty string if first],played_cards:[card_id1|card_id2|card_id3|card_id4 - empty if didn't play]"
    8) play card: "play_card:[card]"
    9) server response: "ok" or "bad_card" or "bad_play"
    10) round end: "round_winner:[team],scores:[team]*[points]|[team]*[points],round_cards:[card_id1|card_id2|card_id3|card_id4]"
    11) game over: "GAME_OVER"
